# RAG Project Design Overview

## Introduction
The RAG Project aims to build a robust framework for document retrieval and processing, leveraging modern techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. This document outlines the design architecture, key components, and interactions within the project.

## Architectural Overview
The architecture of the RAG Project follows a modular design, where each component is responsible for a specific task. This allows for easy scalability and integration of new functionalities.

## Key Components

### Loaders
- **Description**: Loaders are responsible for ingesting various document types (e.g., CSV, JSON, HTML) and converting them into a standardized format for processing.
- **Classes**:
  - `CSVLoader`
  - `JSONLoader`
  - `APILoader`
  - `PDFLoader`
  - `CodeLoader`
  - `HTMLLoader`
  - `TextLoader`

### Splitters
- **Description**: Splitters divide large documents into smaller chunks based on specified criteria, enabling more efficient processing and retrieval.
- **Classes**:
  - `CharSplitter`: Splits based on character count.
  - `CodeSplitter`: Splits code files using language-specific rules.
  - `HTMLHeaderSplitter`: Splits HTML documents based on header tags.
  - `RCTSSplitter`: Uses recursive character splitting.

### Retrievers
- **Description**: Retrievers query the processed documents to return relevant information based on user input.
- **Classes**:
  - `PGVectorRetrieval`: Utilizes vector-based retrieval techniques to fetch documents from a database.

### Pipelines
- **Description**: The pipeline orchestrates the flow of data through loaders, splitters, and retrievers to achieve the desired results.
- **Implementation**: Details on how to set up and use pipelines in the project.

## Data Flow
1. **Document Ingestion**: The process begins with document loaders ingesting data from various sources.
2. **Document Processing**: Loaded documents are then processed by splitters to create smaller, manageable chunks.
3. **Retrieval Process**: The retrieval module queries the processed chunks using a defined algorithm to return the most relevant information.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration of New Loaders**: Support for additional document formats and sources.
- **Advanced Retrieval Techniques**: Implementing more sophisticated retrieval algorithms, such as neural retrieval models.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhancements to improve the efficiency and speed of document loading, splitting, and retrieval.

## Conclusion
The RAG Project is designed to provide a flexible and efficient framework for document retrieval and processing. Its modular architecture facilitates the addition of new features and improvements, positioning it for future growth and adaptation in the rapidly evolving field of NLP and Machine Learning.
